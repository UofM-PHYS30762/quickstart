# C++ at the University of Manchester: quickstart guide - WIP

This guide contains instructions on how to set up your laptop for coding, compiling and running C++ programs. 

## Instructions if you bring your own laptop 

### Windows computers

#### Installing a compiler

We suggest to install the latest gcc compilers using mingw. Simple instructions on how to do this are

#### Installing a text editor

You can use any text editor you'd like, and we suggest an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code. You don't need to use all the features (e.g. automatic compilation etc...) and we will not necessarily do so in the course, but this provides a terminal as well where you can enter your commands as well as the text editor. 

You can download and install Visual Studio Code from <[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)>. This website also has instructions on how to set up and configure the IDE to work with the gcc compiler above.

### Linux computers

The installation of the compiler and text editor of your choice will depend on the Linux distribution you have - feel free to fork this repository and make a pull request for your configuration as it will help others! 

## Instructions for lxplus

If you have an lxplus account, all you need to do is to set up a compiler, and you're all set! You can take the compiler from the most recent LCG releases: [etc etc]
